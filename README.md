# Final-Python-Project
Final Game for IT-140 class.

There are many rooms on the exploration base Theta on TOI-540 b. As a Junior XenoRanger, you must explore base Theta using the commands: Move and North, South, East, or West and search for parts in each room to build the Laser Vertoratio before meeting the Alien. Good Luck!
